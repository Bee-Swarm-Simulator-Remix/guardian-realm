# Automoderation

SudoBot can also automoderate your server(s). You need to configure it according to your needs, which can be done at the dashboard or if you're an advanced user, you can use the `/config` slash command with appropriate options.

### Command Syntax

```
/config <key> [value]
```

If only the key is specified, then the value will be shown. Otherwise the new given value will be written to config database.

## What can the bot do?

* Spam Filtering (Message Rate-limiting)
