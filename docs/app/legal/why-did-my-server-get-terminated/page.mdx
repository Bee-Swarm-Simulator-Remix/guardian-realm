# Why did the bot in my server get terminated?

Probably because your server violated the Terms of SudoBot. Violation of the [Terms of Service](terms.md) is not acceptable and may cause termination without prior notice. It's not possible to appeal once your server gets terminated.

We expect fair usage of the bot and other services provided by OSN Developers Team. That includes but not limited to:

-   No spamming with the bot
-   No engaging with illegal activities using the bot
-   Don't try to harm the bot or any other individual
-   Don't try to attack/harass any person involving the bot

After all these, OSN Developers reserve the right to terminate your access to the bot at any time, for any reason.
